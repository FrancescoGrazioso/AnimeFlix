# AnimeFlix

This project has the purpose to provide a free streaming app for anime.
At this moment we count a 500 titles catalogue, everything dubbed or subbed in italian.
I'm sorry for the slow development but i'm alone and i have a job; this is just a side project.
The application is open source so you can view the source code and interact with it, if you find a bug feel free to open an issue.
(Will add some screen when GUI will be in a good state)

The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
